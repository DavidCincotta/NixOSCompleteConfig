# NixOSCompleteConfig

This is an ongoing project to create a easily deployable and configurable Nixos Installation.

The goal of this is mainly to teach myself system basics that are not taught in university.
For example, I repartitioned some old flash drives using fdisk, created some miscilanious
scripts, learned the usefullness of scripting, really the lessons are endless. 

I will continue to update and show the progress with this operating system, as it is my daily
driver. 



Some things I want to accomplish in the future:

	Easy installation scripts:
		network drivers
		change file destinations
